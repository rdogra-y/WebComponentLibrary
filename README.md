# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Web Component Library - Storybook

This is a React-based UI component library built with Storybook and Docker.

## 📖 Running Storybook

Storybook is used to develop and test UI components in isolation.

1. **Install Storybook**
   
   npx storybook@latest init
  

2. **Run Storybook**
   
   npm run storybook
   
   If the default port (6006) is unavailable, Storybook will suggest an alternative port (e.g., 6007, 6008).

3. Open Storybook in the browser:  
   - [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) 

##  Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**
   docker build -t dogra_rakshita_coding_assignment12 .

2. **Run the Docker Container**
   docker run -p 8083:8083 --name dogra_rakshita_coding_assignment12 dogra_rakshita_coding_assignment12


##  Creating UI Components with Storybook

1. Inside `src/components`, create a new component folder, e.g., `Button`.
2. Add a `Button.tsx` file with the component code.
3. Create a `Button.stories.tsx` file for the Storybook integration.
4. Restart Storybook to see the new component.

Example `Button.tsx`:
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

export type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
};

const StyledButton = styled.button<ButtonProps>`
  padding: 10px 20px;
  font-size: 16px;
  border: none;
  cursor: ${({ disabled }) => (disabled ? 'not-allowed' : 'pointer')};
  background: ${({ disabled }) => (disabled ? '#ccc' : '#007BFF')};
  color: white;
  border-radius: 5px;
`;

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, disabled = false, onClick }) => {
  return <StyledButton disabled={disabled} onClick={onClick}>{label}</StyledButton>;
};

export default Button;


Example `Button.stories.tsx`:

import React from 'react';
import { Meta, StoryFn } from '@storybook/react';
import Button, { ButtonProps } from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Button',
  component: Button,
} as Meta;

const Template: StoryFn<ButtonProps> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  label: 'Primary Button',
  disabled: false,
};

export const Disabled = Template.bind({});
Disabled.args = {
  label: 'Disabled Button',
  disabled: true,
};
